# TaskFlow

A minmalist Task Management system built with the idea of testing out my capablilites. It accomplishes all the requirements of a skill assessment done.

**Things to note**
- Dummy JSON data is used for both the todos, and the auth, i.e to use a test credential, you'll need to visit https://dummyjson.com/users
- Also, since data is obtained from dummyjson.com, users can create new tasks, and only edit or remove existing tasks for users, and not the created ones.
- A test credential that can be used is emilys, and emilyspass.
- This project is more or less a test of strength and served to learn new concepts like Optimistic UI Updates
